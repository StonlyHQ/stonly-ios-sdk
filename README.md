Stonly iOS implementation.
v1.0.23

Stonly: modern knowledge for customer service.

Installing the SDK allows you to add guides and tours directly into your app. You build and manage the content from Stonly's web interface.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

1. Add the Stonly pod to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Stonly'
```

2. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
pod install
```

3. Open your project using the `.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file.

4. Import Stonly in your Swift files:

```swift
import Stonly
```
